# GitHub Action: cvmfs-contrib/github-action-cvmfs
[![ubuntu](https://github.com/cvmfs-contrib/github-action-cvmfs/workflows/ubuntu/badge.svg)](https://github.com/cvmfs-contrib/github-action-cvmfs/actions?query=workflow%3Aubuntu) [![macOS](https://github.com/cvmfs-contrib/github-action-cvmfs/workflows/macOS/badge.svg)](https://github.com/cvmfs-contrib/github-action-cvmfs/actions?query=workflow%3AmacOS)


This GitHub Action sets up CernVM-FS for use in GitHub Workflows.

## Instructions
You can use this GitHub Action in a workflow in your own repository with `uses: cvmfs-contrib/github-action-cvmfs@v2`.

A minimal job example for GitHub-hosted runners of type `ubuntu-latest`:
```yaml
jobs:
  ubuntu-minimal:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: cvmfs-contrib/github-action-cvmfs@v2
    - name: Test CernVM-FS
      run: ls /cvmfs/sft.cern.ch/
```
By default 	`*.cern.ch, *.egi.eu, *.opensciencegrid.org *.hsf.org` repositories are available.

The Action also works with runners of type `macos-latest`, however in this case it is necessary to specify which repositories you want to mount (via the variable `cvmfs_repositories`), as there is not auto mount for macOS. A minimal example of usage on `macos-latest` is:
```yaml
jobs:
  macOS-minimal:
    runs-on: macos-latest
    steps:
    - uses: cvmfs-contrib/github-action-cvmfs@v2
      with:
        cvmfs_repositories: 'sft.cern.ch'
    - name: Test CernVM-FS
      run: ls /Users/Shared/cvmfs/sft.cern.ch/
```
Beware that because the runner cannot be rebooted in the macOS case, the repositories are mounted under `/Users/Shared/cvmfs/`

## Minimal Example

The following minimal example, which is also a workflow in this repository at [.github/workflows/minimal-usage.yml](https://github.com/cvmfs-contrib/github-action-cvmfs/tree/main/.github/workflows/minimal-usage.yml), sets up CernVM-FS and lists the contents of the selected repositories from `*.cern.ch, *.egi.eu, *.opensciencegrid.org *.hsf.org`.
```yaml
name: Minimal usage
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: cvmfs-contrib/github-action-cvmfs@v2
    - name: Test CernVM-FS
      run: |
        ls /cvmfs/lhcb.cern.ch
        ls /cvmfs/auger.egi.eu
        ls /cvmfs/dune.opensciencegrid.org
        ls /cvmfs/sw.hsf.org
        ls /cvmfs/sft.cern.ch
```

## What Does This Action Do?

This GitHub Action installs the [CernVM-FS package](https://cernvm.cern.ch/fs/#download), and configures it with the  `CVMFS_CLIENT_PROFILE='single'` and `CVMFS_USE_CDN='yes'` to avoid any overhead on the CernVM-FS stratum 1 servers that you are accessing, this GitHub Action uses the [OpenHTC](https://openhtc.io) caching edge servers.

## Limitations

This GitHub Action is only expected to work in workflows that [run on](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idruns-on) ubuntu and macOS targets (and even then likely only `ubuntu-latest`). This exludes the `windows` targets.

## Use With Docker

In case your workflow uses docker containers, the cvmfs directory can be mounted inside the container by using the flag `-v /cvmfs:/cvmfs:shared`.
